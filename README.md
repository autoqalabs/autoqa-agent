# AutoQA Agent

An AI testing agent from [AutoQALabs](https://autoqalabs.com). Give it the address of your web app and it works like a QA engineer who has just joined your team:

1. **Explores** the app in a real browser and maps its user journeys.
2. **Plans** what to test, rated by risk.
3. **Writes** a Playwright test suite, in a consistent house style.
4. **Runs** it, fixes its own test mistakes and reports the real bugs.
5. **Repairs** the tests when your UI changes, without hiding real bugs.

What you keep at the end is an ordinary Playwright suite that you own. Re-running it needs no AI and takes seconds.

## Use it in four steps

You need [Node.js 22](https://nodejs.org), [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, then run `claude` once to log in). The agent runs on a Claude subscription, so there is no API key to buy.

**1. Get the agent**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autoqalabs/autoqa-agent.git
cd autoqa-agent
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

**2. Tell it where your app is**

Create a file named `.env` in the folder:

```
TARGET_URL=https://staging.your-app.com
```

If the app has a login, add a test account. The agent never sees the password (see [Credentials](#credentials)):

```
TEST_USERNAME=qa@your-company.com
TEST_PASSWORD='the password'
```

**3. Run it**

```bash
npm run generate:demo
```

A browser window opens so you can watch the agent work, next to a live panel that narrates every step. A first run takes roughly 15 to 25 minutes.

**4. Read the results**

- `runs/<run-id>/report.html`: the whole run in one page you can open, print to PDF or send to someone. It has the summary, every bug report with its screenshot, the test plan and the journey map.
- `runs/<run-id>/report.md`: the same report as Markdown, for reading in the repo or in a pull request.
- `runs/<run-id>/bugs/`: one report per real bug, with steps to reproduce.
- `generated-tests/`: the Playwright suite. Run it again any time with `npm test`.

That is the whole loop. When your app changes later, one more command repairs the suite:

```bash
npm run heal:demo
```

## What you get

| Output | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| Journey map | The app's routes and user journeys as the agent found them, with the exact element names tests will use |
| Test plan | Test cases rated by risk, including what it decided not to test and why |
| Playwright suite | Page objects and specs: role-based locators, no hard waits, no CSS selectors |
| Bug reports | One per real defect: severity, steps to reproduce, expected and actual result, evidence |
| Run report | Suite summary, the meaning of every failure, the bug list. Written as Markdown and as one self-contained HTML page |
| Replayable log | Every step the agent took, viewable in the live panel afterwards |

**See a real one:** [examples/demo-store-report.md](examples/demo-store-report.md) is the unedited report from the agent's first run on our demo store.

## Results so far

| App | Run | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Our demo store, never seen before | Explore and write, about 18 minutes | 25 tests written. 21 passed, 4 failed. All 4 failures were real bugs, including a critical one: guest order pages were visible to anyone with the link. |
| The same store after a button was renamed | Repair, about 3 minutes | 9 tests broke on the renamed button. The agent traced them to one locator, changed that one line and the suite passed 25 of 25. |
| The same store, renamed button plus 4 planted bugs | Repair, about 7 minutes | It repaired the locator and refused to "fix" the 6 tests failing on the planted bugs. It left them failing and wrote a bug report for each. |
| A third-party practice app behind a login | Explore and write, about 13 minutes | 21 tests written, signed in with a test account. 20 passed, 1 failed on a real bug. |

Each suite was run on one machine against one environment; these are results from our own runs, not a benchmark.

## How it works

The agent is [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) running without a chat window, driving a real browser through [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp). Its QA judgment is written down as skills.

| Piece | Where | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runner | `bin/autoqa.mjs` | Starts the agent, locks its browser to your app's address and records every step |
| Rules | `CLAUDE.md` | Stay on the target, use test data only, never weaken a test to hide a bug, narrate each step |
| Skills | `.claude/skills/` | How to explore an app, design tests by risk, write Playwright in the house style, and tell a broken test from a real bug |
| Live panel | `bin/panel.mjs` | A local page showing each step as it happens, or replaying a past run |

**The skills are the product.** They hold the method: what to test first, which locators survive a redesign, what counts as a bug. Tailoring them to a team's own standards changes how the agent works without touching the code.

## Self-healing

UI changes are the main reason test suites rot. `npm run heal` re-runs the suite against the changed app, reproduces each failure in the browser and sorts it into one of two kinds:

- **The test broke** (a renamed button, a moved field, changed test data): it repairs the test, in the page object where the locator lives.
- **The app broke** (a real defect): it leaves the test failing, unchanged, and writes a bug report.

The second half matters as much as the first. A tool that makes every red test green hides the bugs the suite exists to catch.

## Credentials

For apps with a login, the agent signs in with a test account without being given its password:

- **The agent only knows the names.** It types the text `TEST_USERNAME` and `TEST_PASSWORD`, and its browser swaps in the real values and masks them in everything the agent reads back.
- **They stay out of the logs** and the live panel: the runner replaces the values with their names.
- **They stay out of the tests.** The suite reads them from the environment at run time. A setup step signs in once and the signed-in tests reuse that session.
- **The agent cannot open your settings files.** Git ignores them too, so they are never committed.

This keeps credentials out of the AI's view, the logs and the repo. It is not a hard security boundary, because the tests themselves need the password to sign in. Use a low-privilege test account on a test environment, never a real user's or an admin's.

Before a full run, `npm run check-login` confirms in about a minute that the test account can sign in.

## What it can and cannot test

**It works on** web apps reachable in a browser, at desktop and phone screen sizes, with or without a login.

**It does not handle:**

- native mobile or desktop apps;
- sign-in that needs a CAPTCHA, a one-time code (2FA) or an email link;
- sign-in through another site, such as Google or Microsoft;
- very large apps in full: it covers the main journeys, not every page.

**Point it at a test environment.** The agent creates accounts and places orders, so it should never run against production or real customer data.

## Your tests stay yours

This repo contains the agent and nothing else. The tests and reports it writes for an app are never added here: they belong to that app's owner and are kept separately and privately.

## Commands

```bash
npm run generate:demo    # explore, write and run tests, with a visible browser and the live panel
npm run generate         # the same, in the background
npm run heal:demo        # repair the suite after the app changed, with browser and panel
npm run heal             # the same, in the background
npm run check-login      # confirm the test account can sign in
npm test                 # replay the suite, no AI involved
npm run test:ui          # replay it in Playwright's UI mode
npm run report:html      # build and open the run report as one HTML page (newest run, or name a run id)
npm run report           # open Playwright's own HTML test report
npm run panel            # open the live panel and replay a past run
```

**Other settings**, all optional and listed in `.env.example`:

- `LOGIN_URL`: the sign-in page, if it is hard to find from the app's navigation.
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: other addresses your app needs, such as an API on a different host. The agent's browser blocks everything except your app's address and these.
- `EXCLUDED_PATHS`: routes the agent must leave alone. To add them, open the app's settings file (`.env.<name>`, or `.env`) and list the paths with commas between them, for example `EXCLUDED_PATHS=/internal,/api/billing`. Each path starts with `/` and covers everything under it. For a single run, pass `--exclude /internal,/api/billing` instead. Nothing else is skipped, so an admin area you do not list gets tested, and the report names the routes that were left out.
- `MAX_MINUTES` and `MAX_TURNS`: the run limits. Every run stops by itself when it reaches either one, so a run that gets stuck or keeps repeating a step cannot go on for hours. A turn is one step the agent takes, such as opening a page or writing a file. The defaults are 60 minutes and 500 turns for `generate`, 30 and 300 for `heal`, and 5 and 40 for `check-login`, about three times a normal run. To change them, set them in the app's settings file, for example `MAX_MINUTES=120` and `MAX_TURNS=900`, or pass `--max-minutes 120 --max-turns 900` for a single run. A stopped run keeps what it wrote and says which limit it reached.
- **Several apps:** give each its own settings file, `.env.<name>`, and add `--site <name>` to a command.

## Licence

The agent is free to install and run for evaluation. Production use, redistribution and building products or services on it need an agreement with AutoQALabs. The full terms are in [LICENSE](LICENSE). The tests and reports it writes for your app are yours.

## Work with us

AutoQALabs sets this up on your application, tailors the skills to your team's standards and maintains the suite as your product changes.
