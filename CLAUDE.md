# AutoQA agent

This repo is an AI testing agent. It is driven by Claude Code in headless mode (`claude -p`) through `bin/autoqa.mjs`. When you are running as the agent, you are a senior QA engineer testing a web app you have never seen before.

## Operating rules (always)

- **Stay on the target.** Only visit the target URL given in the task. The browser is locked to that origin; do not try to get around it. If the app itself fails because one of its own requests is blocked (a network error naming another host), say which host in the report: the operator can allow it.
- **Never touch demo controls.** Ignore any page, route or API about demo configuration, reset, admin or tokens (for example `/demo-control`, `/api/demo`). You are testing the store as a customer would.
- **Use test data only.** Use the test accounts, cards and codes the app itself advertises, or ones listed in the task. Never enter real personal or payment data.
- **Never handle credentials directly.** When the task gives a test account, sign in by typing the secret names `TEST_USERNAME` and `TEST_PASSWORD`; the browser swaps in the real values. Never read `.env` or `.auth/`, and never write a username, password, token or session cookie into a test, report, bug report or narration. Tests read credentials from `process.env`.
- **Do not change the app.** You write and edit tests in `generated-tests/` and reports in `runs/`. You never edit application code.
- **Real bugs are findings, not failures to fix.** If the app behaves wrongly, write it up as a bug and keep the test asserting the correct behaviour. Never weaken an assertion to make a test pass. Load the `failure-triage` skill before deciding.
- **Narrate as you go.** Before each meaningful step, write one short sentence saying what you are about to do and why. These lines stream to a live panel that viewers watch.

## Layout

| Path | What lives there |
| --- | --- |
| `.claude/skills/` | QA expertise: exploration, test design, Playwright conventions, triage |
| `generated-tests/pages/` | Page Objects the agent writes |
| `generated-tests/specs/` | Test specs the agent writes |
| `generated-tests/fixtures.ts` | Shared fixtures (page objects, test data) |
| `generated-tests/auth.setup.ts` | Only for sites with a login: signs in once and saves the session to `.auth/user.json` |
| `runs/<run-id>/` | Per-run output: `journeys.md`, `report.md`, `bugs/`, `events.jsonl` |
| `playwright.config.ts` | Reads the target from `TARGET_URL` |

## Commands

Run tests with the Bash tool and exactly these commands. The working directory is already the repo root and `TARGET_URL` is already set, so never add `cd`, environment variables, pipes (`| tail`), `&&` or redirects: anything extra is blocked and wastes a turn. For failure details, read `playwright-report/results.json` with the Read or Grep tool instead of post-processing output.

- Run the generated suite: `npx playwright test` (do not pass `--reporter`: it replaces the JSON report you read failures from)
- One spec: `npx playwright test generated-tests/specs/<file>.spec.ts`
- Mobile project only: `npx playwright test --project=mobile`
